Loto Punto is not available as an open-source project primarily due to the significant value of its intellectual property and competitive advantages. By maintaining proprietary control over its technology, Loto Punto ensures the protection of its innovative solutions, such as its real-time fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, AI-powered KYC system, and microservice-oriented architecture. These proprietary technologies provide Loto Punto with a unique edge in the market, enabling them to offer secure, efficient, and user-friendly services that distinguish them from competitors. Additionally, keeping the project closed-source helps safeguard sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the system, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or manipulation. Ultimately, this approach allows Loto Punto to continue delivering exceptional value to its users while preserving its strategic advantages in a competitive landscape.
